### 🔬 Research Methodology  
  
This thesis employs a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** approach to:  
- Analyse current AI applications in manufacturing quality control  
- Identify performance metrics and implementation challenges  
- Evaluate processing times
- Provide strategic recommendations for industry implementation  
  
---  

### 📈 Data Overview
The systematic literature review encompasses:

- 68 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2025)
- Multiple manufacturing sectors (automotive, electronics, textiles, etc.)
- Performance metrics analysis across different AI approaches
- Processing time evaluation for real-time implementation
  
### 📊 Key Findings  
  
- **Processing Time Analysis:** Most AI-based quality control systems operate under 100ms  
- **Performance Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores  
- **Industry Applications:** Wide applicability across manufacturing sectors  

### 🏢 Industry Collaboration
This research was conducted in collaboration with Kemény Boehme Consultants SE, providing:

- Real-world manufacturing insights
- Industry validation of research findings
- Access to automotive supply chain expertise
- **Note:** Internal KBC data used for plot calculations cannot be published due to confidentiality agreements:
